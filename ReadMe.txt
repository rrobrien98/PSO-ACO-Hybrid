To run this project, simply execute the main method of Lab.java
The program will then start.
The parameter/position values of the particle currently being executed will appear in sequence on the first line,
followed by the graph edges colored by each successive iteration of the ACO that particle created.
As such, after the text "Initializing Project..." each pair of lines represents a single particle evaluation in PSO
